This is my note of fault diagnosis
reference book is: Model-based Fault Diagnosis Techniques-Design Schemes Algorithms and tools, Steven X.ding 
chapter 3
#### objective
to model a class of dynamic systems,which consist of a process,actuators and sensors for the control and supervision purposes.
our major objective of addressing moddelling issues is to describe nominal and faulty system behavior.
#### mathematical models for linear dynamic systems
input-output description
state space representation
#### coprime factorization
coprime factorization is one key tools for our our study. //现在还不懂这个点，记得查找资料
#### linear time invariant system
there are two standard mathematical representations for LTI systems.
1.the transfer matrix
1.state space
