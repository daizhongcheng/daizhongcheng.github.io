#### what is matrix?
Definition 1: A rectangular array of numbers of the field F

$ \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &  a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix} $ is called a matrix.
when row=column,the matrix is called square and the number m equal to n,is called it's order.
in the general case the matrix is called rectangular(of dimension  $m \times n $) 
##### elements
the numbers that constitute the matrix are called its elements.
##### subscript
the first subscript always denotes the row and second subscriptdenote the column
#### multiplication of matrices
generally the 2 matrices A and B,AB ~= BA
for example
$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \neq \begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} $ 
if AB = BA,we can say its permutable.
